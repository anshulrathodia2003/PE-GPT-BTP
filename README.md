# PE-GPT Open Source Initiative

## 📌 Overview  
This repository is inspired by the research paper:  
> **PE-GPT: A Hybrid AI Framework for Power Electronics Design**  
> *(IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics)*  

The original work demonstrated how **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** and **Physics-Aware Neural Networks (PANN)** can work together to design power electronic converters (DAB, buck, etc.) and automate workflows like modulation strategy tuning, parameter selection, and simulation verification.

Our goal is to **open-source a similar framework** for the Power Electronics (PE) community, so that engineers, researchers, and students can easily experiment, extend, and apply this technology to their own design problems.

## 🎯 Our Mission  
- Build an **open-source PE-GPT-like framework**  
- Provide **ready-to-use knowledge bases** for RAG (textbooks, design notes, papers)  
- Create an **easy-to-use app** for students and engineers  
- Leverage **Groq acceleration** for ultra-fast inference  
- **Extend the framework** to new use-cases like UPF rectifier design  

---

## 🏗️ Current Status  
This repository is currently in its **planning and setup phase**.  
We are:  
- Setting up the base RAG pipeline  
- Curating PE-specific knowledge sources  
- Creating a minimal working prototype for a single converter case  
- Documenting the design and testing approach

## 🔮 Future Roadmap  
- ✅ Curate knowledge base for DAB and buck converters  
- ✅ Implement RAG retrieval pipeline  
- ✅ Build a PANN for predicting key converter waveforms  
- ⬜ Integrate simulation verification  
- ⬜ Build user-facing app (web-based or desktop)  
- ⬜ Add more converter topologies (UPF rectifier, etc.)  
- ⬜ Optimize using Groq for real-time design assistance
